# RESTAURANT POS SYSTEM

### Low Cost, Cross-Platform Restaurant POS

This project is being developed using React + Electron + Python + SQLite3.

## Why this stack?

### * ReactJS

&emsp;React provides the high performance for a smooth user experience.


### * Electron

&emsp;Electron allows us to use React for easier desktop application development, this alone increases the development speed.

### * Python

&emsp;Python is used for our API to perform SQL queries. The functions for this project will be very simple and we will only need this to interact with our database.

### * SQLite3

&emsp;This is an improved local database compared to local storage. The aim is to keep this system as simple as possible.
